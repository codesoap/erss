This project is a work in progress. New commands will follow. You will
probably see these added in the future:
- `rss-add-item`: add RSS items to an existing RSS file
- `rss-copy-items`: copy RSS items from one RSS file to another; allows
  filtering of items and modifying the RSS channel's data by creating a
  new RSS file and then copying over existing items
- `rss-tail`: discard old items to reduce file size
